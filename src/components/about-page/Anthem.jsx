            <p>For me to live is Christ,
And to die is gain is the watchword.
Presby Students' Union, a challenge is to your Faith.
Arise to this clarion call, a calling to fulfill,
To help and to serve and to lead others to Christ.</p>
            <p className="text-xl">2x</p>

            <p>
            I will arise to live for Christ,
Brother rise, sister rise
For to die is gain.
Let us arise to the call, So others will resolve
That to live is Christ,
And to die is Gain..
